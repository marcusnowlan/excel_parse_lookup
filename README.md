# excel_parse_lookup
# This is a project in which data from the Excel file agenda.xls (given) is parsed, with the data put into a SQLite database structure (via ./import_agenda.py agenda.xls in the command line). Then, lookup_agenda.py can be used to print data from the SQLite database with a specified column and value (via ./lookup_agenda.py column value in the commmand line, where column is one of {date, time_start, time_end, title, location, description, speaker}, and value is the expected value for that field). The file db_table.py was given as a basic SQLite wrapper and contains useful functions to interact with the SQLite database.
# 
# In this project, agenda.xls was given as a sample Excel file to be parsed, and db_table.py was given as the basic SQLite wrapper to make interacting with the SQLite database easier. Both import_agenda.py and lookup_agenda.py were created as part of the project, to make a SQLite database from the Excel data and to make an easy mechanism for returning data from the Excel file (with specified column and value fields).
